_\<Mild spoilers about game mechanics.\>_

Stephen's Sausage Roll is a sokoban style puzzle game.
Each level is a 2- (but actually 3-) dimensional grid where you push around sausages.
The goal is to cook them without burning them.

It extends typical sokoban mechanics with additional elements:
- Your character now occupies 2x1 space with the fork you're holding, instead of 1x1.
  This makes how you rotate and orient impactful.
- Sausages are also 2x1.
  They roll on their long end but slide on their short end when pushed.
  You need to cook top and bottom 2x1 sides of each sausage.
- Height adds a dimension where objects can be placed on top of one another or on top of you.
- Your fork can be used to stab and pull.

The game does a great job of dropping you right in with zero hand-holding, not even telling you what the goal is.
What's great about it is that at the start the ways in which you can interact with the levels and the game are limited enough that you can experiment and discover victory and failure conditions yourself with no guidance.

Puzzles grow in difficulty slowly, and new mechanics are gradually introduced, but not in an artificial way:
Instead of an ad-hoc notion of "unlocking" some new ability, every mechanic is actually technically available from the get go.
It's just that the earlier level designs don't give you any opportunity to execute them.

Puzzle design is also great.
At the start of the game I was very overwhelmed:
- "I need to rotate but my fork pushes things if I do."
- "Wait, I can't even step on the grill."
- "I have to cook both sides?"
- "Re-cooking _any_ tile of the sausage burns it and it's an automatic failure?? No way! It's just too much!"

However you eventually realize that all these constraints with a small, tight level design is actually a blessing.
By limiting the space of possibilities it actually simplifies the task a lot, it just _looks_ overwhelming in the beginning.
It allows you to break things down into sub tasks of where you can and should be.
Even some of the more wider levels have these constrain bottlenecks sprinkled across the level that keep possible actions from exploding exponentially.

Simplistic but very fun, great little puzzle game!

Some random final remarks:
- IIRC, some puzzles had red herrings! If you think "well, how do I use this part of the level" towards a solution, be careful 🤣.
- I found some of the behavior a bit unintuitive when sausages are on top of you. But puzzles that require you to use such mechanics make use of the more intuitive subset.
- Levels that require you to drop your fork can be difficult!
