Hi. I am an AI Research Scientist at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/tag/data-science/).

Before that, I was a PhD student at [CS](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/), advised by [Claire Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).

And before that, I was an undergrad at [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US), pursuing my BS in [Computer Engineering](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) and BA in [Math](http://math.boun.edu.tr/).

My research interests lie primarily in the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. Currently, I am particularly interested in representation learning and deep learning. My research has been focused on how to learn (possibly deep) representations for compositionality in language, with applications to sentiment analysis, opinion mining, question answering and dialogue understanding. I also regularly collaborate with my former (undergrad) advisor [Ethem AlpaydÄ±n](https://faculty.ozyegin.edu.tr/ethemalpaydin/) on decision trees, neural networks, and some other ML stuff.
